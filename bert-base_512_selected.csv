"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of ""The Natural"".

"Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />Other factual errors: A train is shown to be operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (the red hat), whereas the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.","whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. as others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in iran speaking in arabic, rather than persian. that is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. the landscape could not be more different from the actual. < br / > < br / > other factual : a train is shown to be operating in afghanistan, while afghanistan does not have railways. the turkish ambassador is wearing a fez ( the red hat ), whereas the fez was banned by turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. the turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an indian, and indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. i suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.",1
"This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. He is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.","this is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre : action comedy. conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand - up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. he is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one - liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. and seeing him run ( even back then ) is a pleasant sight. in addition, i have a feeling that pat morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese. don't even get me started about the story. i give it a 2 out of 10.",1

"How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish movie ""Congo Express (1986)""? There are also some characters in congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the wind blows.

"This movie is one of the worst ones of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she knows nothing about acting. All her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story, it is so cookie cutter. It goes from point A to B with little surprise. So much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth watching.","this movie is one of the worst ones of the year. the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. paul rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. i have never watched desparte housewives, so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. it's like she knows nothing about acting. all her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b * * * * and still be entertaining. and the other girl, lake bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them. < br / > < br / > as for the story, it is so cookie cutter. it goes from point a to b with little surprise. so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost. the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit. < br / > < br / > final verdict : it's worth watching.",1

"As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I haven't seen before. There's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)","as far as spaghetti westerns go, i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre. it's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen. guy madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on - screen charisma necessary to pull it off. with one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before. there's just much to get very excited about. < br / > < br / > the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri. she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes.

"I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects. Also, if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as ""Blair Witch"" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything.

"Words can't describe how bad this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that. There are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the technical first, there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. ""Executive Decision"" should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the ""Turbulence""-movies are better.

"Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked.

"Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero...

"This is one of the worst films I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical. First off, there's no plot. The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so stupid. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So dumb.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is better.","this is one of the worst films i've seen. the only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical. first off, there's no plot. the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things. such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. also the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any of romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. and the way the people die is so stupid. it's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, so dumb. < br / > < br / > final verdict : if any of these actors appear in another film, then they've been blessed with a second chance. definitely the film i've seen in years. a b - movie on cinemax is better.",1

"This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse.

"Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters.

"""Back of Beyond"" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. Even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />It may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little different than the usual.",""" back of beyond "" takes place at a dive diner / gas station in the middle of the australian desert run by tom mcgregor ( paul mercurio ), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. we get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister ( though their relationship to each other is better later in the film ) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals. < br / > < br / > we know one thing is for sure and that is mcgregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such - - his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. of course, tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. but not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. in fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale ( and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws ), is almost just as ridiculous. < br / > < br / > it may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little different than the usual.",1
"Black Candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us ""Vampyres"" and much later, ""Rest in Pieces"", among others..I'm only noting the ones I've seen. At any rate, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man keels over. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be devil worship. It's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times. To spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene (I HOPE it's simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. Ugh. At times this echoes ""Rosemary's Baby"", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon. However, the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film. The end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. It's not unwatchable, it's just not very good, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me. 3 out of 10.","black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us "" vampyres "" and much later, "" rest in pieces "", among others.. i'm only noting the ones i've seen. at any rate, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man keels over. not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be devil worship. it's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times. to spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene ( i hope it's simulated ) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. ugh. at times this echoes "" rosemary's baby "", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon. however, the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film. the end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. it's not unwatchable, it's just very good, and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me. 3 out of 10.",1
"The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didn't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then there's the couple that has to have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV! The acting is bearable--not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. She's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere. Otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable.

"I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard).

Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are overacting, and how much the special-FX sucked even back then.

"Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos.

"I remember this show from Swedish television.

Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, never leave me bored while watching!

"Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. Recent adapted travesty's like 'Intimacy' have ruined great writing. But The Mother surpasses all his previous incarnations, eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundrette. A middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter. The fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing. And in Daniel Craig we have a strutting, brash, gruff anti-hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother.

"Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have made it so. Guiness' performance (and a great supporting cast such as Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense.

"A common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. However, rather than epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape.<br /><br />The pace of this movie is slow, contemplative. We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they're connected. For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering, affecting them years after, this movie will more than satiate that longing.","a common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature. in power of kangwon province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular korean parks in the mountains of kangwon province. however, rather than epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape. < br / > < br / > the pace of this movie is slow, contemplative. we learn in the end what really brought each to kangwon province and we learn how they're connected. for those who want hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will satisfy. but for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering, affecting them years after, this movie will more than satiate that longing.",0
"The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look inside Doyle head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.","the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite. it focused on the personal problems doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle's life, i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes. the last 40 minutes were excellent. we finally got a look inside doyle head, how he created holmes and why he had to'kill'holmes. the actors are excellent. including the intriguing selden played by tim mcinnerny, arthur conan doyle, a compelling role played by douglas henshall and brian cox as the'role model'for sherlock holmes, dr. bell. the locations are good, especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice. if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.",0

The villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something.

"BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is an off-the-wall movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to ""psyche-out"" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking ""Wow this this over already?"" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy.

"Gentleman Jim is another case of print the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by Raoul Walsh's vivid direction. Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time).

As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. This wonderful film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace.

"" sophie's choice "" with meryl streep. the second is "" journey of hope "". as human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. we also have to struggle against racism and fascim. we must avoid judging, criticize ; we only have to love our earth companion. this wonderful film, helps us reaching john ( lennon ) his dream : imagine all the people living live in peace. these two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be, but better. great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. enjoy it.",0
"Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox","yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and the bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that i try not to miss. a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though i do miss roberta taylor as inspector gina gold and todd carty as gabriel kent. i will admit, i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a that the programme is now after the watershed, as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8. 00. still, why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. it is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but i really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8 / 10 bethany cox",0
"the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show I'm gonna miss it.","the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called'the days'and their lives. the family consisted of abby day ( mum ), jack day ( dad ), natalie day ( sporty daughter ), cooper day ( outsider son ), and nathan day ( boy genius son ). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, i'm really another season wasn't made. it was a great show i'm gonna miss it.",0

"Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities.

I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. It is worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time.

"I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghost story.<br /><br />Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving.

"In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One can feel, moreover, the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.","in the colonies we're not all that familiar with arthur askey, so i nearly skipped this film ( which had its tcm preview recently ) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in "" ghost train "" - - which i expected to be thoroughly. instead i was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. the physical aspects of askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if charlie chaplin and woody allen had a baby. there is no comparing him to bud abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. one can feel, moreover, the thread connecting askey to british comedy 30 years later ; at least it is clear from an american point of view that he has more in common with the monty python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. as for the rest of the film - - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance.",0
"I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending. No matter how good...bad you are. There is no ending of a chapter to begin another.","i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 ; and at the time it shocked me. i had seen a violent movie before, but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. this movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. crash tried to show how racism was bad ( and crash actually had a built - in anti asian bias ) and to come at it from a morally superior position. grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. especially when you compare the endings. the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending. no matter how... bad you are. there is no ending of a chapter to begin another.",0
"Poorly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster...

"When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story.

"I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time.

"I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes.

This might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong.

"1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' Oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single title: such was the Academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is, arguably, not as good (and I'm half-Polish).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic.

"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers.

"Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (I found only the Egyptian one disappointing). Stragely, all but the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, the widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers.

"Nina Foch insists that ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is very good. Low budget but still entertaining - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short.

"This really is a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to stand up for him.","this really is a great movie. some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever. but basically, all of fred and ginger's movies are the same. after the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. what reallys me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott? his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again. he adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. he has a winning personality and a great smile. randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. ok, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars : errol flynn, alan ladd, victor mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him.",0

"There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look phony.<br /><br />There are two great strengths in this show, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's stylish visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (although stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the earth-bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'.

"The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is?

"This group of English pros are a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of their own. It's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable ""romp"". The only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can readily understand why Robson Green would light her fire, with apologies to the ""Doors"". The guy who almost steals the show with a great ""laid back"" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in ""The Way We Live Now"", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies as I've said could have their own series. They are that good. The whole thing is a great deal of fun, and I heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.","this group of english pros are a pleasure to watch. the supporting cast could form a series of their own. it's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. only the superior acting skills of francesca annis, michael kitchen, and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable "" romp "". the only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering francesca annis would fall in love and actually marry michael kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a british sex symbol. you can readily understand why robson green would light her fire, with apologies to the "" doors "". the guy who almost steals the show with a great "" laid back "" performance is owen's father david bradley. watch him in "" the way we live now "", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. daniela nardini as kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes kitchen he ever looked at her great body. conor mullen, and julian rhind - tutt, as green's sidekick surgery buddies as i've said could have their own series. they are that good. the whole thing is a great deal of fun, and i heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue.",0
"Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her ""Hello Sister""!!!. This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.<br /><br />A sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory  the awkward first kiss & Abhay's swift apology; Abhay describing Soha as ""class wali ladki"" & hastily adding ""that he doesn't love her""; his gifting a churidar to Soha & asking her out for a date.<br /><br />The music is good & the background music excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears. The stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />The poignant ending makes for a bitter sweet film, the memories of which will linger for a long long time.<br /><br />A must see I will rate it 8.5/10","abhay deol meets the attractive soha ali khan and greets her "" hello sister ""!!!. this sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by shivam nair. soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in nainital and come to delhi to marry her lover, shayan munshi. but shyan doesn't turn up leaving soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world.. abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. slowly romance blooms and soha agrees to marry abhay. then shyan re - enters into soha's life. < br / > < br / > a sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in delhi, revolves around the delicate soha. this well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory the awkward first kiss & abhay's swift apology ; abhay describing soha as "" class wali ladki "" & hastily adding "" that he doesn't love her "" ; his gifting a churidar to soha & asking her out for a date. < br / > < br / > the music is good & the background music excellent. in a scene where soha rushes & embraces abhay the sound track disappears. the stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship. < br / > < br / > the poignant ending makes for a sweet film, the memories of which will linger for a long long time. < br / > < br / > a must see i will rate it 8. 5 / 10",0
"For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the Western assault on traditional Serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate. Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's films' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity.

"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. <br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.<br /><br />In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.","no sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. here's a few different slants on it from one of those "" religious nuts, "" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. < br / > < br / > 1 ) "" baby face "" ( 1933 ) offers perhaps the classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. there is a lot of truth to what barbara stanwyck demonstrates in this film : look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free..... and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want. < br / > < br / > in this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money..... lots of it. at least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. < br / > < br / > 2 ) the ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message : all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. a comment that so many "" critics "" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. no surprise, i guess. < br / > < br / > any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start - to - finish and stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. at a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it.",0
"Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I won't do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life.<br /><br />At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.<br /><br />Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself (""I'm going to bury that bastard,"" she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.<br /><br />Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It is tremendously moving.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is superb. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are.","many reviews here explain the story and characters of'opening night'in some detail so i won't do that. i just want to add my comment that i believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life. < br / > < br / > at the beginning myrtle gordon is remembering how'easy'it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. a tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. < br / > < br / > almost - but not quite. at the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself ( "" i'm going to bury that bastard, "" she says of fellow actor maurice as she goes on stage ). it seems almostistic when myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. he knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all. < br / > < br / > some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on myrtle's downward path. i believe this is truly her'opening night'- she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. it is tremendously moving. < br / > < br / > gena rowlands is superb. the film is superb. thank you, mr cassavetes, wherever you are.",0
"I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again. There is brief language in this.

"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic.

"Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience.

"From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2.","from what i've read a lot of people were by this film, compared to part 1. initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be. soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che's life that he started in part 1. part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. it is not soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of che's life had completely different outcomes. he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part 1 than part 2 but that is the reality of che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. the film is far from perfect. it is probably too long. at least in part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. in part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. che's capture and death are dealt with well. the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish. benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian. so if you've seen part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part 2.",0
"I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then.

"It could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art.<br /><br />It is, however, a beautiful movie. I have loved it since local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many love ""The Fallen Idol"" but I am not among them. I think I saw ""Brighton Rock"" once many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.) This is superbly cast. Charles Boyer does not, it's true, come across as Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired, wary, caring. Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl who falls for him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I attribute that to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, is excellent -- as always.<br /><br />And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. She comes across as a precocious early teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She does her best.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly. Not without reservations.

But the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.","it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art. < br / > < br / > it is, however, a beautiful movie. i have loved it since local channels used to show it. graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. some pretty movies were made from his novels and stories. ( many love "" the fallen idol "" but i am not among them. i think i saw "" brighton rock "" once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking fondly of the novel. ) this is superbly cast. charles boyer does not, it's true, come across as spanish. but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character - - tired, wary, caring. lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him. but the supporting players are the best : katina paxinou is excellent. her performance is a little grand guignol, but i attribute that to the director. peter lorre, whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto - like universal language, is excellent - - as always. < br / > < br / > and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart. she comes across as a precocious early teenager. the character wants to be helpful. she does her best. < br / > < br / > i recommend this movie highly. not without reservations. the reservation is, primarily, that it is a little stolid. but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.",0
"Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me. I either really love them or I loathe them. Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy. Some of the smaller ones, I really loved. Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly.<br /><br />The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother.<br /><br />Although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. Like most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption.<br /><br />For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels.","stephen king movies are a funny thing with me. i either really love them or i loathe them. some of the fancier productions ( such as desperation and storm of the century ) i didn't enjoy. some of the smaller ones, i really loved. sleepwalkers is one that i really do enjoy and watch it regularly. < br / > < br / > the story revolves around charles brady and his mother mary. they are sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. they are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. when they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. the story revolves around what will happen with the girl. will charles spare her or use her to save his mother. < br / > < br / > although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. like most stephen king stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. the acting isn't the, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to'gel'and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption. < br / > < br / > for uk readers : this production has most recently been shown on bbc1, sci - fi and sky thriller / horror channels.",0
"I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had ""more important"" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too ""girly."" <br /><br />Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it.

"New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46-years-old and fading fast; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV reviewers poke fun at Caine, and he gets drunk.

"I hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in great style!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! STanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its best.

"It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. It's a fun film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies.

"I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.<br /><br />After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.<br /><br />One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts.

"I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a Hollywood film isn't - original, creative, quirky and humorous. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. The brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design and (fairly) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />It's just a shame so few people know about Nothing....","i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk. well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a hollywood film isn't - original, creative, quirky and humorous. it seems that today no - one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film. < br / > < br / > i haven't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise - en - scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles. < br / > < br / > i'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well - executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design and ( fairly ) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie. < br / > < br / > it's just a so few people know about nothing....",0
"Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favourite movie.<br /><br />I don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and lovable script.<br /><br />The charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has loved it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.","reading some of the comments on the message boards here i was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when i watched it i could not stop laughing! it has officially become my new favourite movie. < br / > < br / > i don't know what all the here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. i am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. this one was almost all women - with the exception of seth meyers, justin hartley and the brief appearance of will arnett - and it worked. all of the actresses delivered very funny performances ( especially missi pyle ) from a quirky and lovable script. < br / > < br / > the charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message : accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. light - hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more'fun'conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be. < br / > < br / > missi pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all - female cast and lack of a big - name actor to get the studios behind it, and i have to agree. everyone i've recommended this film to has loved it and i think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful. < br / > < br / > i highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female - centred comedy.",0
"But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..enjoy! <br /><br />Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. He really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and to make his brother proud of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking.

No such luck. Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on.

"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is seriously underrated, and it shouldn't. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up.<br /><br />My point: Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they don't stare at them like they're aliens.

"This is definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It's a real pleaser to anyone. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense.<br /><br />Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.<br /><br />This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time I crack up when watching this movie, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy never ends! <br /><br />This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.<br /><br />One scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.<br /><br />Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!","this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made. it's a real pleaser to anyone. it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll put you into suspense. < br / > < br / > basically, what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. they don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness. < br / > < br / > this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in. he provided the voice of shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy, the himalayan cat. but seriously, what this movie is all about is chance! voiced by michael j. fox ( my all - time favorite actor ), chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time i crack up when watching this movie, it's because of chance ; it's like the comedy never ends! < br / > < br / > this movie is also very at times. it sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets. < br / > < br / > one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound ; i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. the movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one. < br / > < br / > overall, it's a wonderful family movie. if you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!",0
"For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old Indian believe that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very different. At times it resembles Spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. I believe David Feiss who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).<br /><br />If you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying.

"This was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very height of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method. The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly because it starred Bette Davis. IN my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much better film - better made in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week!","this was probably one of the most well - made films of the 40's - warner bros. at the very height of their style. the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing. max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method. the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. it's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make "" now, voyager "" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly because it starred bette davis. in my opinion, "" the gay sisters "" is a much better film - better made in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper - critical perfection. each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. most of the complaints i've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. if you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. i'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week!",0
"First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a huge Justin fan, but I did like this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it well done. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflicted, but I honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was kind of just there. HIs character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can do no wrong.<br /><br />Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. Truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find any of that. Every shooting had a point, it wasn't clichéd, pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.","first off, i'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan, but i did like this movie. < br / > < br / > i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about. i didn't find justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. the story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but i found it well done. l l cool j's character was clearly conflicted, but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. morgan freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as i love kevin spacey, he was kind of just there. his character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's kevin spacey, he can do no wrong. < br / > < br / > surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times. < br / > < br / > i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that. every shooting had a point, it wasn't cliched, pretty solid really. < br / > < br / > overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen. i would say it's worth seeing.",0
"Oh, those sneaky Italians. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M.

This of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch.

"10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well.

"The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.","the 14 year - old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with lord of the rings, harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office. this year will see ( and already has seen ) several more, most notably the golden compass, which has the most exciting trailer i've seen this year. stardust, based on a novel by neil gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. i saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. the critical reaction is kind of. i wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because i went to see stardust, and i loved it. it's not a huge movie like lord of the rings. the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles. but within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. it's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. and it succeeds wonderfully. there were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. there's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. it isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has ( though i don't like it quite as much as the earlier film ). a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.",0
"Born Again the Limerick: <br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />And live in a little girl's head <br /><br />Revenge he would get <br /><br />For the murder he met<br /><br />By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />For me Born Again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy. Its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge.

"I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. A very disturbing one at that.<br /><br />In a way, Zero Day is very comparable to ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's shot completley with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against there High School entitled ""Army of 2"".<br /><br />The whole story is told in Video Diary form, from the 2 kids. It shows there relationships with there parents, amongst other people, showing that these are just normal kids, just like people we know or who have bumped into. We find out The Army of 2's last mission will be entitles Zero Day. They plan to shoot up there High School.<br /><br />You see how they get access to there guns, how they plan it out, everything. They stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. Like I said, this is all told in Video Diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day.<br /><br />The actual shooting is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school. Chilling indeed. The movie is very chilling. Some of the things they say, how they plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself. He says ""Andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag"".<br /><br />I'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. You really need to see it yourself. It's going around festivals right now.<br /><br />A+.","i was lucky enough to see zero day last night. it's an amazing movie. a very one at that. < br / > < br / > in a way, zero day is very comparable to "" the blair witch project "". it's shot completley with handheld camcorders. it's about 2 kids. just your average kids. andre and calvin. they start a campaign against there high school entitled "" army of 2 "". < br / > < br / > the whole story is told in video diary form, from the 2 kids. it shows there relationships with there parents, amongst other people, showing that these are just normal kids, just like people we know or who have bumped into. we find out the army of 2's last mission will be entitles zero day. they plan to shoot up there high school. < br / > < br / > you see how they get access to there guns, how they plan it out, everything. they stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. like i said, this is all told in video diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after zero day. < br / > < br / > the actual shooting is shown through survillence cameras throughout the school. chilling indeed. the movie is very chilling. some of the things they say, how they plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. one quote that i remember is the only time calvin is byhimself. he says "" andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. i don't know what he's thinking, but the only way i'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag "". < br / > < br / > i'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. you really need to see it yourself. it's going around festivals right now. < br / > < br / > a +.",0
"Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as light as a feather.<br /><br />Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br /><br />Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the lively screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh. A super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in ""Memento"" and ""The Matrix,"" I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such fine comedienne chops.) <br /><br />The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. For me anyway, ""Fido"" is a hoot!

"The arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo... <br /><br />The commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison... Train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches... There were even buffalo killing contests... ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo... Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting... Few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds... <br /><br />""The Last Hunt"" holds one of Robert Taylor's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept Taylor as a heavy guy...<br /><br />His characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its potential: The will to do harm to another... <br /><br />When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (Stewart Granger) it is evident that these two contrasted characters, with opposite ideas, will clash violently very soon...<br /><br />Taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts... He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses... He even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (Debra Paget) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...<br /><br />Among others buffalo hunters are Lloyd Nolan, outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner; Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed; and Constance Ford as the dance-hall girl... But Taylor steals the show...

"Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. ""Written on the Wind"" very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant.<br /><br />This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar?<br /><br />","director douglas sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. this lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie.

"You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of ""Death To Smoochy"", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". ""The Night Listener"", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.<br /><br />This is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.<br /><br />This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.","you know, robin williams, god bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade ( with perhaps the exception of "" death to smoochy "", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic ). the dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially "" insomnia "" and "" one hour photo "".
