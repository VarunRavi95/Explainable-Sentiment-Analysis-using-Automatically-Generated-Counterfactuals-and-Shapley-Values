# Text_Mining_Project
This is a repository for the Text Mining Project on Explainable Sentiment Analysis using Automatically Generated Counterfactuals and Shapley Values.

The augmented dataset here consists of the original and human generated counterfactuals dataset from Kaushik et.al and automatically generated counterfactuals from Yang et.al. 

Additionally, there is a notebook performing analysis on the Robustness and Interpretability of SVM, BERT and ROBERTA using Counterfactuals and the SHAP python package.
