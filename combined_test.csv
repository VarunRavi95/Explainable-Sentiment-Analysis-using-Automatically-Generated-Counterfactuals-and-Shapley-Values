351,"i've seen many of guy maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />another thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. this one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />as i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review, i will mention that the actor playing ""guy maddin"" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.",0
929,"i thought this move was very good. there were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall, i was quite surprised. the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic, but was real enough to be entertaining. i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts.",1
721,"stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things: action and thrills. the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. richard widmark, edward albert, and eli wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is never made clear. hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere. while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view, the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it. kramer's direction is devoid of any style. it's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />the acting is fine with hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark's cruel lackey. even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman's sidekick. one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman's wife. we're told she's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang. kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. it's a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell.",0
670,"this movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices.<br /><br />movie history: the director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. when his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly contrive a story. he claimed he was making a movie called ""the brain that wouldn't die."" eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his ""so called movie."" that night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and ""the brain that wouldn't die"" was born.<br /><br />i hate this movie! plot synopsis: the main character's fianc√© is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). he grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. after reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. that is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. at the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. the monster appears with little to no explanation. however, the monster saves a hooker and i assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />side notes: the end credit screen claims that the movie is called ""the head that wouldn't die"".<br /><br />i hate this movie!",0
781,"i'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-christian pseudo-documentary got. now, i respect the guy's opinion and faith, i myself am not, at this state, believer of the taught christian doctrine. however, anti-christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />this film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. i'm not recommending against seeing it. in fact, i think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. and this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to christian teachings. rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the christian school that affected his childhood. it also misrepresents the christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation in between.<br /><br />the director uses movie scenes from passion of christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti-christian historians and writers. i actually found the headmaster to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. i also strongly doubt that any of the christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />with this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of christianity. but the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased.",0
70,"i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. and it was nice, but the movie is trash. i can handle b-grade, i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp (ie. 'surf nazis must die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. this movie has very little to offer.",0
1234,"as a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show! i was drawn to watch this by the presence of richard (captain midnight) webb who plays the colonel in charge of the event. what surprised me was the stunning performance of doris day. outside of 'calamity jane', i've never seen her put over a song better than she does here. randolph scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. it's been a while since i saw the movie but i was almost sure humphrey bogart put in an appearance. with so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. if it ever turns up on a tv station near you, be sure to catch the doris day sequence, if nothing else!<br /><br />",1
1210,"in the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. the three principals, all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so i wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. it would be nice if this could get away from the art houses and into the multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.",1
1057,"it appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. it's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.<br /><br />jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight. at one point, she gets to sing a snippet from carmen, followed by the final trio of faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then ""aloha oe"" on the beach! <br /><br />it's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove.",1
229,"you know what you are getting when you purchase a hallmark card. a sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. you get the same with a hallmark movie. here we get a ninety year old ernie borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. poor ernie, he is the poor soul that married ethel merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. in this flick, ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. we have seen it before. you might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned.",0
1513,"i've read a few of the reviews and i'm kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over. its easy to do because its not a book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />colm feore does, at least for a recovering ""f@g-hag"" like myself, a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. i mean, the man really can't get much more pale! though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end.<br /><br />if you need decrepit, there are a few sking movies you might like.<br /><br />being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic, the druggie brother {david cubitt} was the trick for me. i'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick- and believe me that's good. and, as an aspiring writer, moimeme, i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews. but i'm more prosy than poetic.<br /><br />i may be easy to please, but i enjoyed it. a nice story pretty well put together- by canadians, quelle surprise. just toed the line of the 'movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, greatly appreciated. and it was rather cleverly portrayed.",1

940,"tis is a farly typical tom and jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. the characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. the best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. a word of warning-it is most unwise to allow tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! highly recommended.",1
3277,"granted this one is up to par to the other movies but i think through fault of her own. i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper - crust lady. accent whatsoever. i think all the strange accents were distracting - boyer was certainly spaniard. it was hard to keep straight which country people were from. < br / > < br / > i really hated the black and white cinematography. mood is used to negative affect - i especially dislike the fog scene. i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film. paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr. muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. wanda bendrix also does quite poorly in portraying the child else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time ( though she appears much younger ). turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.

644,"i watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies. but still i think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all. the reasons why are many.<br /><br />the acting isn't all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's chevy chase comedy. i mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats ok. but if i hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse. like the ending, it came very suddenly, and i felt like i got no closure what so ever... sebastian changed very suddenly, and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. the score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all...<br /><br />they should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn't, and therefore, this movie turned out bad...",0
605,"this movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie i've ever seen. and that's saying a lot, considering i've seen such stinkers like demon of paradise, lovers' lane, and bloody murder (which is a close second). however, i love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. at times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick. as for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. the acting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. the policeman was the most stone-faced, monotone actor i've ever seen. the best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. a giant safety pin?! what were they thinking? who's the killer? a disgruntled ""huggies"" employee? i'd have to give this movie an overall zero, but darned if i didn't have a blast watching it",0
2131,"a lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. but, despite good acting by robert young and eve arden, the movie is a success. instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. in other words, she stares off into space and has a "" golly i am soooo stunned "" expression. after just a few minutes it really became clear for me. now this is certainly not the only crawford film i thank for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting - - in films such as johnny guitar or many of her later films, such as berserk! my advice is to try a different crawford film - - there certainly were better.

251,"this movie should be nominated for a new genre: complete mess! except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore, this movie is a complete waste of time. calling it ""campy"" doesn't even cut it. ""campy"" implies fun which this movie was not. you spend the first half of the movie thinking ""its got to get better, right?"". in fairness, it does, at the very end when its finally explained who the ""brother/sister"" team are and what they want but by then, you hardly care anymore because you've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr. onorati & ms. pacula do to tick someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible movie.<br /><br />",0
2118,"firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. in the advertising of this movie, that i've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it, but she's a good actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be ( not that that has anything to do with the movie ). and what's with that look she gives everyone? perhaps it's part of the character, but like i said, the acting. . . still, the writing is fine. you know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an easy way.

179,i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged. the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform. her humour is also to be appreciated. she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage. however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. can't say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed. all said apart from ariauna's performance it is indeed utter trash.,0
2423,"while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic, i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. like many spanish horror films, this one stars paul naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. i haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two : i believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. there's a lot of good things i can say about the film itself ; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for. i certainly don't recommend it!

1392,"paul verhoeven's de vierde man (the fourth man) is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen. it really was a pleasant surprise. the story concerns bi-sexual writer gerard (jeroen krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser christine (ren√©e soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story. verhoeven and cinematographer jan de bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away. this is by far verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to robocop). true the fourth man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked. this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. i even like the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 8/10",1

1647,"i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously. i believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. i'm giving all the credit to polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. luckily for me, my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this (so far) but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. this film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. as some performances were done in english (the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others) and others in french (with most other characters) and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french, i heartily recommend, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from french to english and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd. this film is part of polanski's so-called ""apartment building trilogy"" which also comprises ""repulsion"" and ""rosemary's baby"". unfortunately, ""repulsion"" still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1. needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset.",1
1637,"""the plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok (gary cooper), buffalo bill cody (james ellison), calamity jane (jean arthur), george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact, even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. the film is an attempt to buttress custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. truly, this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />transfer: considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. there's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. all in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good ¬ñ just a bit better than middle of the road. age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. the audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />extras: forget it. it's universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. just take its characters and story with a grain of salt ¬ñ in some cases ¬ñ a whole box seems more appropriate!",1

818,"when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction. karloff and lugosi both play scientists (rukh and benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. the science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth ""several thousand million years ago."" in that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call ""radium x"" - which can heal and destroy. a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here. lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in africa. the story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. it was ok - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10",0

829,"i admire 'kissing on the mouth' for its frankness ¬ñ pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director joe swanberg. they weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday ""private"" occurrences. unfortunately, the film falls under the 'the brown bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. yes, it mirrors 'bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing ¬ñ feet, hands or genitals. again, unfortunately, i can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. other than that, it was a complete waste of time. we quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. for this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'the brown bunny.' the only actor that stands out is kate winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (the dvd extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) again, i admire the filmmakers, especially swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat. it has narrations that doesn't fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, other than the soft-porn factor, why you rented this.",0

1945,"if you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it. as an adult, i can't stand it! ! i'm all up for sequels. . . . when they have a decent storyline. but this is near up to standard. please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her. < br / > < br / > i've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.

3427,"this movie is using cinematography fantastically, the depth of the camera catches each character. denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes. how is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. a idea. attenborough at his best since ghandi, this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these, no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african apartheid. though critised for the biased nature, the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace",1
2016,"how disney can you get? is disney trying to send a lesson to itself? that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? whatever the psycho - analysis, this movie worked. < br / > < br / > the girls want a rich party for their rich lives. but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant ( yes, milk ) going to employ the workers. they keep it afloat until daddy comes home. and the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. but the ending is good. webcam in the cayman islands? huh? worth my time ever again. < br / > < br / > but it is better than howl's moving castle.

3130,"honestly, this is just regular people with aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. once they have his stuff. . . they'll sit around and get high again. even if you don't know the story, there is suspense in this movie and surprises. the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. as it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. the bigger story, in more ways than one, is john holmes. he is the center of this story anyway. this movie should have been all about him, his life. < br / > < br / > p. s. although it isn't official, boogie nights is a fictional version of holmes life.

1563,"in this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic k-9, detective dooley [james belushi] and his dog jerry lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [christine tucci] and her partner, a mean doberman named zues who does not get along with jerry lee very well. dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. that all changes as the movie goes along. the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past. there is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. i know that that seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. i didn't see this movie for the jokes, i saw it for two reasons. the first reason is because i am a big james belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. james belushi is funnier than he was in k-9 and the action sequences at are better too. it would have been nice to see more characters from k-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. if you are a james belushi fan, you'll love this movie.",1
2012,". . very good indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched. < br / > < br / > the cinematography is not excellent, but not the best either. the sounds are ok. lighting ok. < br / > < br / > i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film - student. < br / > < br / > the movie does contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain enough. especially the high ratings. . .
